# Inventory-Tracker

## Desktop (Tkinter)

```bash
python app.py
```

On first run, a temporary admin password is generated and shown. Log in as `admin` and set a new password when prompted.

## Web UI (Flask)

```bash
pip install flask
python web_app.py
```

The web UI runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default and uses the same SQLite database. Use the same login credentials as the desktop app.
